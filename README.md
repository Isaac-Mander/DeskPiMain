# DeskPiMain
This is the repo for my DeskPiProject

It contains all my code in one place, so there will be repeats in other repositorys.

adafruit_func.py contains a bunch of functions I have made that makes using systems like adafruit_io easier than working with the raw functions. Feel free to add to it if you feel I have missed something or if there is something you may see as useful.
